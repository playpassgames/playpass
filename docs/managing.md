# Managing Your Game

## Renaming

If you are unhappy with the name you chose for your game you can always rename it with the following command:

```shell
playpass rename
```

> **Please keep in mind all of your existing deployments will be lost.** You will have to redeploy your game afterwards.

A confirmation prompt will pop up and another to select your game's new name. Your custom domain will also be updated to
reflect this change if you have one.

> **Note:** You will lose ownership of your game's old name.

## Deleting

If you need to delete your game you can use:

```shell
playpass delete
```

This will delete your game, including all deployments and custom domains.

> **Note:** You will lose ownership of your game's name.
