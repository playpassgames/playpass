## Features

- Unfancy and understandable ReactJS.
- A header with help, stats, and settings buttons.
- Components for the core parts of the app
- First-time players are shown the help screen before playing.
- Players can play once per day.
- A share button to share the results.

## Getting started

[main.jsx](src/main.jsx) is the entry point into the application. You can configure any
startup logic for your game here. [App.jsx](src/private/App.jsx) is the harness for the overall
structure of the application. It controls the UI and routes some data and control logic
between other components. Feel free to edit it if you need to.
